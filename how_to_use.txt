Basics of jekyll usage

Folders:

/_site: what the static site generator generates. Don't touch this dir!
/_includes: files that should show up on every page (ie header, footer, etc)
/_layouts: layout that content will confirm to. These are templates (HTML) that wrap
           posts and other types of content like pages.

/_posts: put blog posts in here



Misc Info

- 'jekyll serve' runs the server locally on http://localhost:4000. Use this for local
  debugging before committing to site.
