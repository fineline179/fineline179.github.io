    I'm a theoretical physicist, software developer, data scientist, and musician living
    in San Francisco, CA.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm broadly interested in topics in holographic quantum gravity, statistical
    mechanics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>
    In particular, I'm excited about using ideas from statistical physics to inform and
    help explain more "traditional" methods in machine learning. I want to better
    understand how structure emerges in these complex systems, and discover principled
    techniques to design a new generation of algorithms and architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    I did my Ph.D. in theoretical physics in
    the <a href="https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/">Weinberg theory group</a> at UT Austin,
    where I studied with Willy Fischler and Elena Caceres. My research focused on
    building string-theoretic models of quantum chromodynamics and cosmological
    inflation.

  <p>
    My B.S. in physics is from UC San Diego.
