    I'm a theoretical physicist, software developer, data scientist, and musician living
    in San Francisco, CA.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic interests are fairly broad, and include topics in mathematics,
    holographic quantum gravity, statistical mechanics, and machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm excited about using ideas from statistical physics to inform and help explain
    more "traditional" methods in machine learning. I want to better understand how
    structure emerges in these complex systems, and discover principled techniques to
    design a new generation of algorithms and architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    I did my Ph.D. in theoretical physics in
    the <a href="https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/">theory group</a> at UT Austin, where I
    studied with Willy Fischler and Elena Caceres. My research focused on building
    string-theoretic models of quantum chromodynamics and cosmological inflationary
    mechanisms.

  <p>
    My B.S in physics is from UC San Diego.

    Here are
    my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IQS7GmAAAAAJ\&hl=en">publications</a>,
    according to Google Scholar.
