    I'm a theoretical physicist, software developer, and musician living in San
    Francisco, CA.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm broadly interested (and accordingly sparsely published) in mathematics,
    quantum gravity, statistical mechanics and inference, and machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm excited about using ideas in statistical physics to inform and help
    explain more "traditional" methods in machine learning. I want to better
    understand how structure emerges in these seemingly complex systems, and
    discover principled techniques to design a new generation of algorithms and
    architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    I received my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from UT Austin, where I studied
    with Willy Fischler and Elena Carceres.
  </p>

  <p>
    My B.S in physics is from UC San Diego.
