    I'm a theoretical physicist, software developer, and musician living in San
    Francisco, CA.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    I'm interested in mathematics, quantum gravity, statistical mechanics and
    inference, and artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>  
    I'm excited about using ideas in statistical physics to inform and
    help explain more "traditional" methods in machine learning. I want to better
    understand how structure emerges in these seemingly complex systems, and
    discover principled techniques for designing the next generation of algorithms
    and architectures.
  </p>  

  <p>
    I have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Texas at
    Austin, where I studied with Willy Fischler and Elena Carceres.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got a B.S in physics from the University of California San Diego.
